# Homework 2

## Ex. 1 [Cookie Tampering]

Looking among cookies, there is one named `LoginCookie`, which, can be decoded from base64 and the result is:

```admin,1570624508,com402,hw2,ex1,user```

Next trying to change the last value to `admin`, and re-encoding it to base64, substituting it to the original cookie using the browser's development tools, we can successfully hack the platform.

## Ex. 3

Inspecting the page's JavaScript, it is possibile to see that when the login button is pressed, an anonymous function is called. The function, in order does the following:

- Checks that the username and the password aren't too long
- Checks that the password matches the hash generated by an `hash` function that is part of the page's script.

The function takes as argument two strings, a `msg` and a `key`. In the case of the pressed button, the username input by the user and a *one time pad* are passed as arguments. The one time pad is a variable available in clear text, and is "Never send a human to do a machine's job". Then, in order to get the correct password, we can call the `hash` function, giving the username we want to use for the login as `msg`, and as `key` the one time pad. We can then successfully use the resulting hash as password to login.
